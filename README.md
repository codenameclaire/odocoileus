### What the project does
This repository contains the scripts I used to produce the figures for my and my coauthor Eric S. Long's publication, "Allometric brain reduction in an insular, dwarfed population of black-tailed deer", which was published in the Journal of Mammalian Evolution in July 2023.

### Why the project is useful
These scripts (along with their corresponding datasets) have been made public for the purpose of scientific reproducibility. The scripts in this repository were used to create black-and-white scatterplots of data with up to four groupings (ie. "male species #1", "female species #1", "male species #2", "female species #2"). Regression lines are included in the code but line equations are not because ggplot rounds the coefficients in a way that I personally am not a fan of (inconsistent sig figs with no solution I could find). Line equations were added in Adobe Photoshop.

### How users can get started with the project
1. Download RStudio
2. Download our datasets freely available from Dryad: [LINK](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.gqnk98stm)
3. Open one (or more) of the .R files found in this repository
4. Proceed to bust out some sweet plots!
